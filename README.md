## Setup

- Create an account on github: [github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
- Follow [this link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/christianbaumann/untangle-your-spaghetti-test-code) and follow the instructions
- Open `src/test/java/com/agiletestingdays/untangletestcode/unicornservice/UnicornServiceApplicationTests.java` from the file tree on the left and wait for the Java installation to finish

## Objectives

1. Have a look at the [UnicornServiceApplicationTest].
   Which problems do you see?

   - Do you understand **what's being tested**?

   - Is there a proper **arrange, act, assert structure** in the test cases?

   - Are the **names of test cases and variables** consistent?

     Does it help to understand implications of failures?

     Does it help to find the corresponding code?

   - Do you understand **how the test works technically**?

   - Which **layer of the testing pyramid** is this test on?

     Is the layer appropriate for the test cases?

   - Do you see **where the test data is coming from**?

   - Which **code duplications** do you find?<br/>
     How would you reduce them?

2. Let's untangle it!

   - Apply a consistent naming scheme

     Suggestion: `<classUnderTest>Test.<methodUnderTest> [<happyCaseDiffStateUnderTest>]` (see [How to Name Tests for Maintainability](https://medium.com/@michakutz/how-to-name-tests-for-maintainability-c11af89f0f04))

   - Create a `UnicornTestDataBuilder` to reduce the arranging code in all the test cases with it and to make the differences between the arrangements obvious.

   - Replace the [data.sql] with arranging code in your test cases.

   - Push the validation tests down to [UnicornControllerTest]

     The "invalid unicorn test cases" can be tested far more efficiently on a lower level of the testing pyramid.
     Keep only one happy and one invalid case in [UnicornServiceApplicationTest] to test the overall behavior.
